# FaceID_Swift

For creating FaceID using CoreML, we first need a model. This model will help us to detect the respective person to unlock the device.
We have used 3 animals image data - [Cat - Dog - Horse] and created a model.

We have assumed that owner of the device is cat and it will unlock when it will get atleat 95% confident that the user is a cat.
